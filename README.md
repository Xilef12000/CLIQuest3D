## The Project:
This game is a student project which was created for assessment in the winter semester 2023/2024.

## üêß Linux (Ubuntu)
it's important to use a shell which can handle a high throughput (`GNOME Shell` did a perfect job).  
üî® build and start with:  
```bash
sh build.sh
```

## ü™ü Windows
‚ö†Ô∏è Windows support is still an **experimental feature**, a non-optimal display and a low FPS rate are to be expected.  
üî® build and start run:  
```batch
build.bat
```
